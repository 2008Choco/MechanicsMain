### Complete List of Modules
This is the *complete list of modules* for [WeaponMechanics v1.0.0](). This list
will likely be updated whenever a new version is released. To see the history of
changes to this page, [click here]().

Before you scroll down, know that this list is super useful for just copying
and pasting into a `.yml` file, then removing all the modules you really don't
need. You should never really have a weapon that uses every single line here.
Pick the modules that you want your weapon to have, and put those modules together
to create a unique weapon.
