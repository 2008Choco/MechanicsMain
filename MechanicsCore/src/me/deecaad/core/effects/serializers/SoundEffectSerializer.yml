Sounds:
  - <sound>-<volume>-<pitch>                                # Required arguments
  - minecraft:<sound>-<volume>-<pitch>-<delay>-<pitchNoise> # Optional arguments
  - custom:<sound>-<volume>-<pitch>                         # Required arguments for custom sounds
  - custom:<sound>-<volume>-<pitch>-<delay>-<pitchNoise>    # Optional arguments for custom sounds

  # For single line sounds, separate the sounds with a comma (',') with an optional space
  # Valid examples:
  - <sound>-<volume>-<pitch>,<sound>-<volume>-<pitch>,<sound>-<volume>-<pitch>
  - <sound>-<volume>-<pitch>, <sound>-<volume>-<pitch>, <sound>-<volume>-<pitch>

# <sound>: Which sound (Either minecraft sound or resource pack sound) to use
# <volume>: The volume (Recommended generally [0, 4]) of the sound
# <pitch>: The pitch of the sound, [0, 2]
# <delay>: How long before the sound is played (In ticks, 20 ticks = 1 second) (OPTIONAL)
# <pitchNoise>: Randomness to add to the pitch, generally [0, 0.2] (OPTIONAL)
