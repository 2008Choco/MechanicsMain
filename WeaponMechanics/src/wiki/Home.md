## Frequently Asked Questions
> **There is an error in the console when the plugin starts!**

This may be either because you forgot to install [MechanicsCore], *or* because you made an error in config. 
Make sure to watch [CJCrafter's WeaponMechanics instillation tutorial](youtube)

> **Can you add gun (Insert Gun Here)?**

This plugin is programmed so people can be creative and design their own weapons.
The default weapons exist to give people inspiration, not for you to build your server around.
If you do not want to make the weapons yourself, somebody may be willing to commission a weapon pack for you

> **Why use [WeaponMechanics] over other gun plugins like [CrackShot] and QualityArmory?**  

While [CrackShot] is an amazing plugin, it was originally designed for [Minecraft 1.7](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Java_Edition_1.7) (released in 2014) and is no longer updated. With every update to Minecraft, the plugin becomes less reliable.
QualityArmory, while the developer is still active, was never good enough (didn't have enough features) to replace [CrackShot].

[WeaponMechanics], on the other hand, has many more features than both [CrackShot] and QualityArmory.
[WeaponMechanics] is designed for [Minecraft 1.15](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Java_Edition_1.15) and is actively maintained by 2 developers.

> **I purchased [CrackShotPlus], do I also get [WeaponMechanicsPlus]?**

Unknown, 2 very different plugins though so probably not
