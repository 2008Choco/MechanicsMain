## World Guard Flags

[WorldGuard] is a plugin that allows you to form regions. In these regions, you add flags to add functionality.
Using these flags allow you to prevent griefers from destroying builds and/or damaging players.

[WorldGuard] is automatically hooked into, as long as you install [WorldGuard] (Both v6 and v7 are supported).

**`weapon-shoot`**: Denies weapon shooting  
**`weapon-shoot-message`**: Message sent to shooter whenever weapon shooting is denied by the weapon-shoot flag  
**`weapon-explode`**: Denies explosions caused by weapons  
**`weapon-explode-message`**: Message sent to shooter whenever an explosion is denied by the weapon-explode flag  
**`weapon-break-block`**: Denies weapons breaking blocks (By either explosions or general block damage)  
**`weapon-damage`**: Denies damaging entities via weapons  
**`weapon-damage-message`**: Message sent to shooter whenever damaging an entity is denied by the weapon-damage flag
